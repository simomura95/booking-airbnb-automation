Script to send a mail with data scraped from Booking.com and Airbnb.it

Given the two links from the two websites and some parameters to allow for easy modification (eg. number of people and maximum price), this script opens them, scrapes useful data and sends a mail with them.
This saves the user quite some time, automating the research process instead of visiting the websites everyday to check if there are some new hotels.

The file is actually configured to search for an accomodation for 4 people in the period 1-3 November 2023 below 700â‚¬ near Lucca (during Lucca Comics finding a cheap accomodation is very very hard).
